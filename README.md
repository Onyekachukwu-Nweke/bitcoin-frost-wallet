# Bitcoin-frost-wallet ü•∂

A high-performance, secure implementation of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signatures with ChillDKG for Bitcoin wallets in Rust.

## Why Bitcoin-frost-wallet?

Traditional Bitcoin wallets rely on single-signature schemes or complex multi-signature setups. Bitcoin-frost-wallet brings threshold signatures to Bitcoin wallets, enabling:

- **Distributed Key Generation**: No single point of failure in key generation
- **Flexible Signing**: Any t-of-n parties can sign transactions
- **Enhanced Security**: No single party ever holds the complete private key
- **Schnorr Compatibility**: Native support for Bitcoin's Schnorr signatures
- **Performance**: Optimized Rust implementation with parallel computation support

## Project Goals

- Provide a production-ready FROST implementation for Bitcoin
- Enable easy integration with existing Bitcoin wallets
- Maintain high security standards with comprehensive testing
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous signing protocols
- Minimize communication rounds for better performance

## Features

- ‚ú® ChillDKG (Distributed Key Generation)
- üîê Threshold Schnorr signatures (t-of-n)
- ‚ö° Parallel signature computation
- üß™ Comprehensive test suite
- üìä Performance benchmarking
- üîß Configurable threshold parameters
